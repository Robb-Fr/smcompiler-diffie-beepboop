Custom Application: Balelouc Negotiations 

Every year, on the FLEP campus, a big student festival under the name of Balelouc is held. 
The bars on the festival site are held by student associations, such as the IC student association CLIC.
Three parties, the CLIC Bar, the Balelouc festival committee and a drink wholesaler, are trying to estimate 
the conditions under which they could be profitable during this edition of the Balelouc festival. 
The CLIC Bar estimates n_drinks, the number of drinks they believe they will sell during the festival. 
The Balelouc committee estimates festival_price, the price at which they would like drinks to be sold during the festival. 
The drink wholesaler estimates base_price, the price at which it would like to sell its drinks to the festival for resale. 
They would like to each obtain an estimation of how much profit they will make, given the value they have estimated. 
Since this is a negotiation, they do not which to reveal their estimations to the other parties but wish to determine if their aggregated estimations work well together. 

A few precisions: 
- The CLIC Bar agreeed to give two free drinks to the FLEP President, Vartin Metterli 
- They want to compute this overall profit over the next 10 years 

The final value is therefore : P = ((n_drinks - 2) * (festival_price - base_price)) * 10
